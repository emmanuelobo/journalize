# Journalize 📒 ✏️

Journalize is your own personal online journal. Take note of all the important (and not so important) events in life and store them as journal entries. Share these moments with friends and family as you wish. Look back at your collection of journal entries and feel the breeze of nostalgia.


## Getting Started

### Clone repo
Clone the repository to your local

https://github.com/EmmanuelObo/journalize.git


### Setup Virtual Env
Create a python virtual environment either using virtualenv or pipenv (recommended)


### Activate virtual environment
Wherever your virtual environment was created, there is a Scripts folder inside the main folder. Inside the Scripts folder you will see a Lib folder that contains a script activate.bat.
Run that script inside your terminal from your journalize project location to activate the virtual environment for that project.

### Install Dependencies
Inside the app folder there will be a file called requirements.txt.
Run the following command:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Run the App
Now you should be all setup and ready to run the app.
To run the app enter the following script:

`python manage.py runserver`

Then navigate to localhost:8080 and the server should be live

### Start Journalizing!
Create your first entry by clicking the plus button at the bottom right of your screen.
